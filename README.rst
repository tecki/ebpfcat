************************************************
EPBFCat -- an EtherCAT master using eBPF and XDP
************************************************

EBPFCat is a controller for the industrial field bus
`EtherCAT <https://www.ethercat.org/>`_, written entirely in Python,
that uses `ePBF <https://ebpf.io>`_ and XDP to achieve real-time responses.
The EBPF code is generated on-the-fly using a built-in code generator,
which can also be used for other purposes.

The documentation lives on `readthedocs <https://ebpfcat.readthedocs.io/>`_.
